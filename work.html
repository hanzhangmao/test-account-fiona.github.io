    <h2>Fiona's statements about Art</h2>
    <main>
        <p>When winter is coming, Fiona and I often have fights against each other's opinions. Fiona becomes much stronger in the coldest weather. She really wants to display her novel ideas to the public, especially to me maybe. She even comes to my university to give people a speech about her civilism project and her creation of civilism logo consists of patterns of humans. </p>

        <p> For students to know more clearly about the novel ideas, Fiona also introduces the perspectives of Russian Constructivism and conceptual art which was very popular in America. </p>

        <p>And Fiona is kind of against the conventional Conceptual Art that, she considers the process of making art as important as the concepts and ideas made prior to the making process. It is the public engagement that could draw more and more people's attention.</p>

        <p>She also introduces about the importance of the open spaces, the public understandings and their actions, which explains the reason why she loves to involve in to the crowd.</p>

         <p> Fiona claims that her favourite band is Pink Floyd, and one of their song is comfortably numb. The idea of this song is opposed to her perspectives of making art. She wants herself to be a workaholic to keep the consistency of production.</p>
